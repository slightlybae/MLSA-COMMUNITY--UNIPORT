# MLSA-COMMUNITY-UNIPORT

## Welcome to Our Community
This is the repository of Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors Community, University of Port Harcourt, Nigeria

We have resources here that can help you learn more about different topics. You can find articles, links, videos and podcasts that cover different aspects of the subject. These resources are curated by ambassadors and updated regularly. You can access them online or offline, depending on your preference.

We upload all the resources shared on our events and activities on campus.
